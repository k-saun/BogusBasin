* Project Summary
  I've decided to create this project to accomplish the following following goals;
    - Hone my skills as a programmer!
    - Familiarize myself with multiple languages and styles of programming while creating a product that serves a real purpose

  The purpose of the code in this repository is to;
    - Create a mobile application
    - Have this application scrape the bogus basin website to present statistics about snowfall, runs that are open/closed, etc.

  Checkout the progressLog text file to see the problems I've run into, and how I've solved them!
