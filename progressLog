The following is a progress log to document the problems and solutions I run into!

* Jan 15
	Before today the project kind of hit a hitch in its main functionality. I was trying to scrape the 
	contents of bogusbasin.org to allow me to get the most up to date information on their mountain. The 
	problem I was running into is that the library I was using to scrape, cheerio, was not demonstrating 
	its ability to scrape and produce half of the HTML I wanted. It would return null or simply output nothing
	on most of my queries unless I queried for an element that was pre made. IE the mission statement, that 
	is not generated by javascript on arrival to the page.

	Most modern websites use javascript to generate changing information on demand for users. The problem is that
	cheerio would not wait for the javascript to enter in the values that the site is missing. I found a couple of 
	libraries that would allow me to account for that, and I ended up with Nightmare.js, a library that allows me 
	to create a virtual browser and scrape html from there as if a real user was looking accessing it. 

	Tonight I was finaly able to scrape my first value, the temperature at the mountain! Extremely excited.
